# CORD-19 Data Explorer

This project explores the **CORD-19 metadata.csv dataset** using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit.

## Objectives
- Load and clean real-world research data
- Perform exploratory analysis
- Visualize trends and patterns
- Build a simple interactive Streamlit dashboard

## Project Structure
- `data/` → dataset (metadata.csv)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebook for exploration
- `app/` → Streamlit application
- `requirements.txt` → dependencies

## How to Run
### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb

3. Run Streamlit App
streamlit run app/app.py

Dataset

CORD-19 metadata: Kaggle Link

Expected Outcomes

Cleaned dataset

Visualizations of research trends

Interactive dashboard for exploration
